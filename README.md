# Facial-Detection-Application

Web application that I built from a course I took on Udemy.

This application lets the user register a login and sign in. Once signed in a detection box is shown where links to images can be pasted. 
Once pasted, the application uses Clarifai facial recognition AI to detect a face in the photo and draw the corresponding box around
the detected face.
